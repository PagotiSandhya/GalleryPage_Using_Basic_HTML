    <p id="para">Ibn Battuta, or ‘Abu Abd al-Lah Muhammad ibn Abd al-Lah l-Lawati t-Tangi ibn Batutah’ 
        to give him his full name, is a strong contestant for the greatest traveller in history.
        Not only did he travel a distance greater than the diameter of the Earth, he did most of 
        it overland, travelling in caravans at a time when boat was both the much faster and safer 
        option.He travelled from Morocco, his home, as far as Kilwa in modern Tanzania, China, and
        Mali, as well as visiting Mecca,Dehli, Alexandria, Jerusalem, Granada, Sri Lanka, the
        Maldives, and Samarkand, among hundreds of other places.He attended the courts of two 
        different Emperors, Roman and Chinese, and visited the home city of the wealthiest man
        who had ever lived, Mansa Musa of Mali.</p>

        muziejų informacijos, skaitmeninimo ir LIMIS centras, CC BY Once he returned home for good,
        he dictated his travels from memory to a scholar, forming a book called the Rihla (“Journey”),
        or A Gift to Those Who Contemplate the Wonders of Cities and the Marvels of Travelling. 
        An early translation into English retitled the book as The Travels of Ibn Battuta, while
        the earliest Arabic version to be published in Europe was titled in Latin as Descriptio
        terrae Malabar. Both of these are available from The European Library as digitised books,
        via the Austrian National Library and the Bavarian State Library. Hajj Hajj from "[Cassell's
        Illustrated Universal History.]", The British Library, public domain His travels started as 
        a Hajj, the pilgrimage to Mecca that all Muslims must complete, but continued on far past that.
        Even so, this first trip took sixteen months and covered over 4000 kilometres, primarily overland 
        as part of caravans. After completing the Hajj, Ibn Battuta continued on to the Silk Road, including
        the Persian city of Tabriz. Tabriz had long been a major trading centre, and had continued to be so 
        after the Mongols had conquered Persia.</p>
